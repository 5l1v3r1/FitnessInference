This repository contains the code associated with the manuscript

Neher, Russell, Shraiman: "Predicting evolution from the shape of genealogical trees"

"prediction_src" contains the code base used for the fitness inference and prediction
algorithms as well as classes to hold sequence data and trees adapted.

"flu" contains the code specific to our analysis of historical influenza data,
scripts that generate the figures, the influenza sequences and annotation, analysis
results and figure files.

"toy_data" contains src to simulate adapting populations building on the FFPopSim
library. In addition, it contains scripts to analyze this simulated data, the data
itself and the resulting figures.

the script "rank_sequences.py" is a simple wrapper for the prediction tool that
takes a multiple sequence alignment and the name of the outgroup as input (this
outgroup needs to be in the msa). It produces a folder containing a ranking of sequences,
the inferred ancestral sequences, the reconstructed tree, and optionally a pdf of the
marked up tree.
